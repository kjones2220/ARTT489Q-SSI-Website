              We build student-led programs that empower the Black student population at the University of Maryland, College Park academically, professionally, and financially.

              The Student Success Leadership Council hosts four main events to connect alumni, students, staff/faculty, and employers. These four events are FreshCon, NetNite, Brunch For Success, and the Gift of Giving Gala.

              UMSuccess is the digital home for Black students at the university. This is where you can find a spotlight on members within our community through social media campaigns like Souls of UMD or attend a branding and entrepreneurship workshop called Brand Your Shell.

            <p>
              STEP is the original organization out of the triade. STEP was initially created in order to specifically support the Black male community due to the disparities between their graduation and retention rates and the entire university. They have since hosted numerous social and community service events.

              We meet every Friday from 2-4pm in Marie Mount Hall. On some Fridays we host Master Classes that involve bringing back alumni to teach our current members how to excel in the workforce or in their professional endeavors, hosting companies to sit with our student leaders, or speaking with Deans of the Colleges at the university. Some meetings are strictly dedicated to committee meetings for each event group to work on their upcoming event.

              Our organizations are under the Office of the Vice President â€“ Student Affairs, and we are located in the Mitchell Building next to the Armory. Our advisor is Dr. Tony Randall, and he helps us bring our big ideas to fruition. He also serves as a mentor on this campus to both current and past members of all three organizations.
